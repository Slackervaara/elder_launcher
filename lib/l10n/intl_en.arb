Then it is completely free, the other senior apps have paid versions or ads.\n\n To enlarge the text on your mobile phone, there is the Big Font (change font size) app, which can enlarge the entire mobile phone https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a0soft.gphone.bfont . For the keyboard, there is the GBoard app, which makes the keyboard enlarge when you press four squares on it. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin \n\n An alarm button to call SOS is missing compared to BIG Launcher, but install the SOS app of your choice and add it\n\n To uninstall it if it is selected by default, you must go to the previous one, e.g. App Launcher, and select it."
